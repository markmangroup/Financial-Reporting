**Call:** 800-288-2020

**Say:** "Hi, I have an AT&T business account and I'm seeing charges on my credit card ending in 8008 for $75.29 per month. Can you tell me what phone number or service this is for?"

**They'll ask for:**
- Name: Michael Markman
- Business: Markman Group/Markman Associates
- Card: Ending in 8008
- Address: Probably 5301 Burcliff Pl, Raleigh NC 27612

**Once you know what it is:**
- If it's your cell phone: Port to personal AT&T
- If it's an unused line: Cancel
- If it's someone else's line: Decide with them

Then you're 90%+ done! 🚀
