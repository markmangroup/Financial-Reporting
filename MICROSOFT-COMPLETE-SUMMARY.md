## 📊 What You Accomplished

### ✅ Microsoft 365 License Reduction
- **Before:** 11 licenses @ $259.60/month
- **After:** 1 license @ $22/month
- **Scheduled For:** 3/15/2026 (when subscription renews)
- **Why Delayed:** Microsoft only allows license changes at renewal date
- **Current Assigned:** Michael Markman + Carmen (3 of 11 assigned)

### ⚠️ Important Note About Carmen's License
On March 15, 2026, the subscription will drop to 1 license total. This means:
- **Carmen's license will be cancelled automatically**
- Only 1 license will remain active
- You need to decide before March 2026:
  - Keep the license for yourself (Michael Markman)
  - OR transfer it to Carmen
  - OR cancel entirely and use free alternatives

**Recommendation:** Keep 1 license for mike@markman-group.com to preserve the email address for future Markman Group work.
