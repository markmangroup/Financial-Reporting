---

## 🎯 MINIMUM REQUIRED PROOF

For each action, I need **3 screenshots minimum:**
1. **BEFORE** - Show current state (active subscription, old billing, etc.)
2. **CONFIRMATION** - Show the completion/success page
3. **AFTER** - Show new state (cancelled, updated billing, etc.)

**Why this matters:**
- Proves action was actually taken (not just planned)
- Provides audit trail for taxes/legal
- Confirms savings are actually being achieved
- Helps track if anything needs follow-up
