        "extractedText": "1. Project Overview and Strategic Objectives\nProject Overview\nThe objective of this project is to integrate an Azure-based Proposal Application with Salesforce, enabling seamless automation of proposal creation and management. The integration aims to remove manual data entry by establishing automated data synchronization between the two systems, with both automatic and manual options available.\nThis project includes three modules:\n\t•\tModule 1: Adjustments to the Proposal Application to automatically create proposals when opportunities in Salesforce reach the Proposal Prep phase. This is the foundational module upon which the rest of the system relies.\n\t•\tModule 2: Salesforce customization to receive and display data pushed from the Proposal Application once proposals are created or updated in the Proposal Application.\n\t•\tModule 3: A manual data upload option for the Proposal Application, allowing Salesforce to receive data via CSV/TXT file uploads if automatic syncing is not preferred.\nThe client will need to choose between Module 2 and Module 3 depending on their preference for automated or manual data synchronization.\nStrategic Objectives\nThe following six objectives focus primarily on Module 1 and Module 2, as these are foundational for automating the workflow and integrating data across platforms:\n\t•\tStreamline Proposal Management: Automate the synchronization of proposal data between the Proposal Application and Salesforce when opportunities reach specific stages, reducing manual entry.\n\t•\tOptimize Workflow Efficiency: By automating the creation and management of proposals in Salesforce, the process will become faster and more reliable, minimizing the chances of errors.\n\t•\tEnhance Data Integrity: Automatically synchronized data will be validated and standardized across both platforms, ensuring accuracy in reporting and decision-making.\n\t•\tUser-Friendly Interfaces: Ensure that all proposal data, including fields like Material Cost, Labor Cost, and Total Sale, is accessible and editable within Salesforce, improving user interaction and experience.\n\t•\tSeamless Integration: Implement an API-driven connection between Salesforce and the Proposal Application, enabling real-time, bidirectional data flow.\n\t•\tData Security and Compliance: Ensure that all data exchanged between the Proposal Application and Salesforce is secure, using OAuth 2.0 for authentication and protecting sensitive financial data.\n\n\f\n2. Project Methodology\nThis project will be executed following an agile methodology, ensuring flexibility, transparency, and consistent feedback from stakeholders at all stages. This approach will allow us to respond to changing requirements or preferences quickly.\nPhases:\n\t•\tCurrent State Assessment: We will perform an initial analysis of existing systems and workflows, identify pain points, and document all data fields and processes that need to be integrated between the Proposal Application and Salesforce.\n\t•\tKey Activities:\n\t•\tDiscovery sessions with stakeholders.\n\t•\tMapping of current Salesforce Opportunity data fields.\n\t•\tAnalyzing existing Proposal Application workflows and APIs.\n\t•\tOutcome: A detailed As-Is Discovery Report that outlines integration gaps, current workflows, and data flows, along with recommendations for improvements.\n\t•\tSolution Design: This phase will focus on architecting a solution that bridges the Proposal Application and Salesforce seamlessly. This will involve defining data mappings, setting up APIs, and designing the Salesforce UI.\n\t•\tKey Activities:\n\t•\tDesigning APIs for Proposal Application adjustments (Module 1).\n\t•\tCreating new Salesforce data models and UI components (Module 2).\n\t•\tDrafting a detailed technical blueprint for integration.\n\t•\tOutcome: A comprehensive Solution Design Document that details the technical architecture, API connections, UI design for Salesforce, and data flow processes.\n\t•\tDevelopment and Implementation: During this phase, our development team will build and implement the designed solution. The Proposal Application will be adjusted, Salesforce will be customized, and both systems will be integrated. Full testing will be conducted to ensure the solution functions as intended.\n\t•\tKey Activities:\n\t•\tImplementing API connections between the Proposal Application and Salesforce.\n\t•\tCustomizing Salesforce with new fields, triggers, and data flows.\n\t•\tDeveloping the manual data upload functionality (Module 3).\n\t•\tFull system testing, including UAT (User Acceptance Testing).\n\t•\tOutcome: A fully functional, integrated solution with verified functionality and minimal defects.\n\t•\tPhased Rollout: The solution will be deployed in a phased manner, starting with a pilot phase for a small group of users. Based on the feedback from the pilot phase, we will iterate and refine the solution before rolling it out to the entire organization.\n\t•\tKey Activities:\n\t•\tRunning a pilot with a selected group of users.\n\t•\tGathering user feedback and making necessary adjustments.\n\t",
