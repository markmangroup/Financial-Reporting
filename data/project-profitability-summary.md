- Total Costs: ~$165,000
- **Net Loss: -$19,170**
- **Negative margin: -13.2%**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:

### 1. **Which consultants worked on which projects?**

**Swan ($47K)** - Nov 2024 to Jul 2025:
- Projects listed: Laurel AG Data Platform, Metropolitan Partners Analytics Dashboard, Financial Reporting System, Data Integration
- **Question**: What % to Laurel vs Metropolitan?

**Niki ($15K)** - Active throughout 2024-2025:
- **Question**: Laurel? Metropolitan? Both?

**Upwork contractors** (~$40K) - May-Sept 2024:
- Period overlaps with Laurel's initial invoices (Jul-Sept 2024)
- **Question**: Were these working on Laurel initial design?

### 2. **What about other operating expenses?**

Current analysis only includes consultant costs. We also have:
- Software/AI services (Anthropic, OpenAI, ChatGPT)
- Cloud infrastructure (Vercel, MongoDB, AWS, Google)
- Office expenses
- Travel

**Question**: Should these be allocated to projects too?

### 3. **Revenue timing vs cost timing**

- Most Laurel revenue: 2024-2025
- Swan costs: Nov 2024 - Jul 2025
- Upwork costs: May - Sept 2024

**Hypothesis**: Upwork → Laurel initial work, Swan → Later Laurel + Metropolitan

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Map Swan's projects to clients** (need your input)
2. **Allocate Upwork costs** (was this Laurel initial design?)
3. **Allocate other consultants** (Niki, Carmen, etc.)
4. **Decide on overhead allocation** (AWS, software, etc.)
5. **Calculate true project profitability** per client
